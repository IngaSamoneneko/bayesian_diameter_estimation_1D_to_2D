# bayesian_diameter_estimation_1D_to_2D
Implements Bayesian estimation of sphere diameters from chord length measurements in 2D cross-sections. The Jupyter notebook contains a complete workflow for (1) geometric simulation of sphere-line intersections, (2) statistical estimation using rejection sampling, and (3) uncertainty quantification
